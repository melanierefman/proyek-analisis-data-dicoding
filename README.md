# Dicoding Data Analysis Project

## Overview
Bike sharing systems offer automated rental processes, allowing users to easily rent and return bikes from various locations. With over 500 programs worldwide and thousands of bicycles, these systems play a vital role in addressing traffic, environmental, and health concerns. The data generated by these systems, including travel duration and location details, make them valuable for research and city mobility monitoring. They serve as a virtual sensor network capable of detecting significant events within urban areas.
